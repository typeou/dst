Mod characters for Don't Starve Together. Initially created for personal use. Unlikely to be completed.

**Wendov:** Weaker during day, stronger at dusk and night. Regenerative capabilities. **Complete, on Steam Workshop**

**Jordan:** Better at chopping, mining, and fishing. Attacks get stronger and damage vulnerability increases as the player hits attacks and avoids damage. **Code complete, art incomplete**

**Celeste:** Gains sanity from ghosts and graveyards. Animals don't run unless the character has recently attacked. **WIP**

**Lloyd:** Emits a weak sanity aura. Slowly loses sanity when alone. Better at crafting magic items. **WIP**

**James:** Slow, but hits harder. Can make many tools and armour by default. Starts with a hammer. Grows a beard. Immune to fire. **WIP**

**Loney:** Faster. Grows fur that can be shaved for rabbit tails. Lower damage. **Complete**

**Redd:** Emits a weak sanity aura. Slowly loses sanity when alone. Starts with bandages. Can craft healing items for cheaper. Half damage. **WIP**

Art assets not by me.
